# 4. Set up communication channels
Nominated Champions cannot operate on their own, and it works best when they
really feel the (meta) team spirit - so the next step would be to set up
communication channels. Depending on the corporate culture, it could be e.g. the
following:

- private Slack / IRC channels
- Keybase teams
- Skype group chats
- Yammer groups
- mailing lists
- Google Forms

The more the better, really - just make sure there is an easy way to spread
important information and get feedback. Additionally, set up periodic sync ups
to see how things are going, and to adjust short-term goals together. For the
beginning, bi-weekly meetings should do fine.

Don't be afraid to share the results and achievements of the group organization-wide. Also, checking in through  1:1s might work better for some people and allow you to get more in-depth feedback on specific Champions or situations.

As a side note, make sure the environment communications are non-toxic and that all Champions feel safe to voice their questions, concerns, and proposals.
